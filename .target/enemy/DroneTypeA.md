# Drone Type A

### Wander State
Because this enemy type is ground platformer and we implement the simple state machine, so we can use AI State machine based. In this enemy scene, we will use fixed point to determine waypoint of wander state

Point to develop
-> Drone should be randomly wander to point that manually created in editor
-> Drone can go on slide tiles
-> Drone can't fall or jump
