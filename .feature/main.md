# Simple Platformer Creative Chain Project

This project is iterative project from before. But, in this project we use feature oriented to control the feature and scale the project

Also, in this project we learn git and still learn 2d Platformer. We will marked this project as async to move to another type of game

So, with feature oriented, we will learn game feature by pieces so we know to create the platformer feature and make ourself comfortable on game development
